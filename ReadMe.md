  # README Creator ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-purple.svg)
  
  ## Description
  
  This command line app allows the user to use a README template to create a customized README based on industry best practices. After responding to a series of questions, the app creates a new README file that the user can then copy and paste in their current project. This project taught me how to use Node to create an application without any front-end functionality.
